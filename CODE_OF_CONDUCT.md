# 🛡️ Code of Conduct & Community Covenant

We are professionals. To protect the high-quality and focused environment required for innovation, we pledge to treat each other with respect.

## 1. Professionalism & Critique Culture
Ideas can be criticized harshly here, but people cannot. Technical disagreements are natural and necessary; personal attacks are unacceptable.

> **Scenario:**
> * **Correct:** "The loop in this function degrades performance; we should rewrite it using `map`." (Focus on code).
> * **Incorrect:** "You wrote terrible code again, you don't know what you're doing." (Focus on person).

## 2. Zero Tolerance Policy
We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, discrimination, mobbing, or threatening behavior. No discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or age is accepted.

> **Scenario:** *If a member persistently sends unwanted messages or makes sexist/racist jokes to another member, this is considered a "security violation," not "freedom of speech." They will be removed from the community via the Jury process.*

## 3. Anonymity & Privacy (No Doxxing)
We respect our members' right to privacy.
* **Right to Pseudonym:** Members may contribute using a pseudonym. You are not required to share your real name or image to participate.
* **No Doxxing:** Sharing a member's real identity, location, or private information without consent is grounds for immediate expulsion.

> **Scenario:** *If a member uses the alias "CyberDev," no one can pressure them by asking "What is your real name? Where do you live?".*

## 4. Reporting & Enforcement
Anyone who believes rules have been violated can report it to the community.
* **Process:** Allegations are reviewed by the **"Random Jury"** defined in the GOVERNANCE file.
* **Outcome:** Depending on the severity, the Jury may issue a warning, a temporary suspension, or a permanent ban.
