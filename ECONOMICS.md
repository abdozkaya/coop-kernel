# 💰 Economics & Distribution Model

There is no promise of a fixed salary in this cooperative; there is a guarantee of a fair share of the value created together. We use the "Pool Model".

## 1. The Point System (Labor Unit)
We measure labor in "Points," not currency, because the value of money changes, but the value of labor is constant.

`Points = Hours Spent x Complexity Multiplier`

**Complexity Multipliers (Default):**
* **1.0x (Standard Tasks):** Documentation, Testing, Community Support, Translation.
* **1.2x (Specialized):** Frontend Development, UI/UX Design, Content Creation.
* **1.5x (Critical/High Risk):** Core Backend, Security Architecture, DevOps, Database Management.

*(Note: The gap between multipliers never exceeds 1.5x to maintain solidarity.)*

## 2. Revenue Distribution (Pool System)
When the project generates revenue (donations, sponsorships, sales), it is distributed immediately.

1.  **Reserve Fund (%20):** This portion is set aside in the "Common Wallet" for general expenses (servers, domains, etc.) and future R&D.
2.  **Distributable Pool (%80):** The remainder is distributed to members who earned points that month.
3.  **Point Value Calculation:** `Money in Pool / Total Points Generated That Month`

> **Example Calculation:**
> * **Total Revenue (This Month):** $10,000
> * **Reserve Fund (%20):** $2,000 (Saved for future)
> * **Distributable Pool:** $8,000
> * **Team Total Points:** 400 Points
> * **Value of 1 Point:** $8,000 / 400 = **$20**
>
> *If Mark has 15 Points:* 15 x $20 = **$300** is deposited to his account.

## 3. Financial Infrastructure & Security (Where is the Money?)
To avoid trust issues, funds are never held in a single member's personal account. One of the following two methods is used:

* **Method A: Fiscal Host (Recommended):**
    * A "Virtual Collective Account" is opened via platforms like Open Collective.
    * The client pays the platform's bank account and receives an invoice from them.
    * Money appears transparently in the cooperative's balance. No one can "run away" with the funds.

* **Method B: Multi-Sig Crypto Wallet:**
    * A multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe) is used for crypto payments.
    * For funds to leave the wallet, a digital approval from a majority of trusted members (Signers) is required (e.g., 2 out of 3).

## 4. Financial Transparency (Open Ledger)
There is no secrecy regarding money.
* **Visibility:** Every cent entering the cooperative's account and every expense incurred is visible to all members.
* **Audit:** Any member can cross-reference payments with GitHub work logs. The answer to "Who got paid what?" is always open.
