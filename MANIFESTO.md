# 📜 The Manifesto

We are creators who believe there is a more sustainable, fair, and producer-focused way to develop software. This community exists not by legal mandate, but by the free will of members who unite around the following principles.

### 1. Collaboration Over Hierarchy
We believe responsibility comes from active contribution, not static titles. Authority belongs to the one who solves the problem, not the one sitting at the head of the table.

> **Scenario:** *If a "Senior Manager" forces a technically flawed decision, the technical objection and solution proposed by a "New Contributor" who knows the subject is more valuable and will be implemented.*

### 2. Shared Ownership & Decision Power
The value we produce belongs to the community that creates it, not to capital holders.
* **Licensing Freedom:** Members democratically decide whether products will be open source, closed source, or commercially licensed based on sustainability and goals.
* **Sustainability:** Our goal is not just to write code, but to build economic models that ensure the well-being of our members.

> **Scenario:** *The cooperative may make its internal communication tool Open Source. However, if it develops security software for a bank, it may protect it with a "Commercial License" to generate revenue. The decision belongs to the community.*

### 3. Default Transparency
Trust is achieved through visibility.
* **Financial Transparency:** Every cent earned and every expense incurred is visible to all members.
* **Governance Transparency:** No decisions are made behind closed doors.

> **Scenario:** *A member does not need to ask "Why did server costs go up last month?". They can check the financial dashboard, see the invoice, and verify the expense log with their own eyes.*

### 4. Right to Fork & Its Limits
The ultimate freedom is the ability to leave. However, this freedom is balanced by professional responsibility.
* **Internal Projects:** For the cooperative's own open-source projects, members have the right to fork the code and leave if they disagree with the structure.
* **Client Work & Privacy:** Work done for external clients is bound by contracts (NDAs) and client privacy. These projects cannot be copied or moved externally. Professional reputation comes before personal freedom.

> **Scenario:** *A group disagreeing with management can fork the open-source "VPN Tool" and leave. However, they cannot take the "Proprietary Accounting Software" being developed for a client; doing so would be a betrayal of the client and the contract.*

### 5. Mathematical Fairness
We reject opaque salary structures. We commit to distributing value using mathematical formulas that apply equally to everyone, regardless of gender, location, or bargaining power.

> **Scenario:** *Two developers, one in London and one in Istanbul, completing a task of the same difficulty in the same amount of time, receive the same points and the same payment. Geography or cost of living does not bias fairness.*
