# 🌍 Co-op Kernel: Open Source Software Cooperative Core

**Co-op Kernel** is a framework for independent developers to unite and create value on a collective foundation. It is a transparent, modular, and democratic **software cooperative core.**

This structure fills the gap between the rigid hierarchies of traditional corporations and the unstructured nature of volunteer projects. It provides a ready-to-use **operating system** for managing labor, voting rights, and revenue, independent of legal status.

## 🎯 Why Start a Software Cooperative with Co-op Kernel?

Software teams often fall apart not due to technical issues, but due to "human" issues (unfair distribution, unclear governance). Co-op Kernel solves these problems with mathematical and democratic rules.

### 1. A Democratic, Fair, and Free System
Here, there are no bosses; there are protocols.
* **Voting Rights (1 Person = 1 Vote):** Those who contribute labor govern, not those who provide capital. Whether you are a founder or a new member, your vote carries equal weight in critical decisions.
* **Contributor vs. Member Balance:** Anyone can contribute ("Contributor"), but those who consistently commit labor and earn trust ("Core Member") gain a say in governance. This protects meritocracy.
* **Freedom (Right to Fork):** The system's ultimate guarantee is the right to leave. If the community becomes corrupt, a minority group is free to copy the project and the rules (Fork) and go their own way. No one is locked in.

### 2. Algorithmic Fairness (Formula-Based Earnings)
Value distribution is based on open formulas, not subjective opinions or negotiation skills.
* **The Logic:** `Time Spent` x `Complexity Factor` = `Your Share`.
* **The Result:** Regardless of seniority, you receive a share of the project's revenue equal to the actual value you produced. It is transparent and non-negotiable.

### 3. Fluid Governance (Progress Without Meetings)
Bureaucracy must not stop production.
* **Lazy Consensus:** You don't need permission. Announce what you are going to do; if no technical objection is raised within 48 hours, it is considered approved. We reward coding, not debating.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Build Your Software Cooperative Now

Follow these steps to establish your own democratic software community.

### Phase 1: Lay the Digital Foundation
You don't need a physical office, but you need a digital HQ.
1.  **Create a GitHub Organization:** Open a free GitHub Organization (e.g., `github.com/OurCoop`).
2.  **Copy This Core:** **Fork** this repository (`coop-kernel`) into your organization or use it as a Template.
3.  **Name It:** Rename the repository to `meta` or `governance`. This repo will serve as your cooperative's constitution.

### Phase 2: Configure the Constitution
Customize the rules to fit your team's needs.
1.  **Sign the Manifesto:** Read `MANIFESTO.md`. As founding members, add your names to the bottom (via Pull Request) to make your first commitment.
2.  **Adjust Economics:** Open `ECONOMICS.md`.
    * Are the complexity multipliers (e.g., Backend 1.5x) suitable for you?
    * Is the Reserve Fund rate (20%) sufficient? If not, edit and `Commit`.

### Phase 3: Connect the Tools
Set up the technical infrastructure for transparency.
1.  **Communication (Discord/Mattermost):** Set up your server and add the invite link to the `README.md`.
2.  **Finance (Open Collective/Crypto):** Open a page on Open Collective or create a Gnosis Safe wallet. Add the links/addresses to the repo.
3.  **Admin Dashboard:** Enable **GitHub Pages** for this repository to publish the `admin/dashboard.html` file. You now have a publicly accessible payout calculator website.

### Phase 4: Start Producing and Sharing
Start the engine.
1.  **Invite First Members:** Add trusted developers to the organization.
2.  **Open the First Issue:** Define a task and add a difficulty label (e.g., `score:1.5`).
3.  **Develop & Distribute:** At the end of the month, when the project generates revenue, check the Admin Dashboard to see who earned what and distribute the payments transparently.

> *"Congratulations! You now have a software cooperative with no boss, clear rules, and fair revenue sharing."*
